# Stars ✨.

Addon for [Godot](https://godotengine.org) that adds a class `Stars`. `Stars` loads real star data from the [HYG database](https://github.com/astronexus/HYG-Database). This addon can be useful for space games and other games where you need stars. In the demo I also use my [Godot](https://godotengine.org) addon [FreeCamera](https://github.com/divin/FreeCamera), feel free to check it out.

TODO:
- [ ] Adjust colour of stars, depending on colour index.
- [ ] Adjust alpha of stars, depending on distance.
